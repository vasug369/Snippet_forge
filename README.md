# Snippet Forge

## Project Overview
"Snippet Forge" is a Node.js-based application designed for saving and managing code snippets efficiently. The application leverages MongoDB for database management and provides a RESTful API for seamless interaction. The primary goal of Snippet Forge is to streamline code snippet handling processes, thereby improving efficiency and organization for developers.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Node.js
- **Database:** MongoDB

## Objective
Develop a Node.js-based application for saving and managing code snippets.

## Features
- **RESTful API:** Provides endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting code snippets.
- **User Authentication:** Ensures secure access and management of snippets through authentication mechanisms.
- **Snippet Management:** Allows users to organize and manage their code snippets efficiently.

## Purpose
Streamline code snippet handling processes for improved efficiency and organization.

## Implementation Details
1. **Backend Development:**
   - Utilized Node.js and Express.js to create a robust backend server.
   - Implemented MongoDB for efficient storage and retrieval of code snippets.
2. **RESTful API:**
   - Developed endpoints for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on code snippets.
   - Ensured secure API access with user authentication mechanisms.
3. **User Authentication:**
   - Integrated user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure access control.
4. **Snippet Management:**
   - Provided tools for users to easily manage their code snippets, including tagging and searching functionalities.

## Future Enhancements
- **Enhanced Search Functionality:** Implement advanced search features to help users quickly find relevant snippets.
- **Collaboration Features:** Allow multiple users to share and collaborate on code snippets.
- **Integration with IDEs:** Provide plugins or extensions for popular IDEs to directly save and manage snippets within the development environment.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd snippet-forge
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

  ```sh
  POST /api/snippets
  ```

- **Get All Snippets:**
  ```sh
  GET /api/snippets
  ```

- **Get a Snippet by ID:**
  ```sh
  GET /api/snippets/:id
  ```

- **Update a Snippet:**
  ```sh
  PUT /api/snippets/:id
  ```

- **Delete a Snippet:**
  ```sh
  DELETE /api/snippets/:id
  ```

## Conclusion
"Snippet Forge" is a powerful tool for developers looking to manage their code snippets efficiently. With secure user authentication and comprehensive snippet management features, it aims to enhance productivity and organization in the development process.
